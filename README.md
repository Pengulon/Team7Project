Team1Project
============
Use main in headers folder. It should be working. You can test the insert, remove, etc. menu options.

Things that still need to be done:

1. File i/o (read from file, insert data to hash and bst, write data to file)

2. Input validation for all user inputs

3. Test cases

4. Documentation

5. Move team report 1 and 2 to new catalyst forum
