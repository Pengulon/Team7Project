Team1Project
============
Use main in headers folder. It should be working. The hash table and bst are empty right now, but you can still test the insert, remove, etc. menu options with your own input.

Things that still need to be done:

1. File i/o (read from file, insert data to hash and bst, write data to file) <- finished, read my desc

2. Input validation for all user inputs

3. Test cases

4. Documentation

5. Move team report 1 and 2 to new catalyst forum
