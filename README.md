- Ethan
I tested the code and its working fine. But one node is either empty or reading blank data. Also the range for rating doesnt include 10 or 0. and the year allow me to put in year 0.
- Brandon
The empty node was because there was a single blank space after Titanic in the movie source file. I fixed the range for rating and year.
